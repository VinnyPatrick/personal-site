    <h1>Hi!</h1>
    <p>I'm Vinny Patrick</p>
    
    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p2><img src="meandaggy.png" alt="me and aggy" class="abtimg"> 
        <br>My names Vinny Patrick, the East End's very own fitness and creative extraordinaire! At 32 years
        <br>young, I spend my days as a personal trainer, whipping people into shape and helping 
        <br>them achieve their fitness goals.
        <br>
        <br>But it's not all burpees and protein shakes for me. In my free time, I indulge in a variety
        <br>of creative hobbies, including web development, music creation, and 3D animation.
        <br>I've been strumming my guitar for 15 years now, so if you need a musical maestro, I'm your guy!
        <br>
        <br>When I'm not working up a sweat or flexing my creative muscles, I loves to travel. I've been to 
        <br>Iceland twice, once solo and once with my girlfriend & I've even learned the Icelandic language. 
        <br>In May, my girlfriend and I are heading up to Scotland for a week to explore the beauty of nature 
        <br>in a campervan. Who knows what kind of fitness and creative inspiration we'll find on the open road?
        <br>
        <br>Oh, and did I mention that I'm also a proud dog dad?
        <br>I have a 6-month-old Chihuahua named Lagertha (aka Aggy), whom I love to walk, train, and spoil.
        <br>In fact, I often jokes that I spend more time playing with Aggy than I do playing my guitar!
        <br>
        <br>And last but certainly not least, I'm an avid West Ham fan, despite our terrible form.</p2>
